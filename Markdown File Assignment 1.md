## **Task: Create a new Markdown file in this repository**

- What I've learned:
1. Text can be written in different ways, being ***italisized***, **bolded**, etc.
2. [Links can be imported, such as this one that takes you to google](https://www.google.ca)
3. >Quotes can be done using this function

- What I am confused about / need to work on:
1. The math sides of code, such as making arrays, if statements, etc.
2. Whether running code using GitHub submits it for marking or not?
3. Overall, I need to practice going through GitHub and Jupyter
